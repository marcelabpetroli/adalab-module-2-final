## Breaking Bad Characters Finder 💎🛢🪰👨🏻‍🔬👨🏼‍🔬💰

This project was created for the final individual evaluation of the JavaScript Module of Adalab's Web Development Bootcamp.

# What is the web for?

- The web page enables the user to search for characters of the series Breaking Bad.
- When the search input is empty, all main characters appear in the screen, with their photo, name and status. When the user searches for a specific character only the ones that match the name are shown.
- After finding the characters, the user can choose to select them as favorite and so, all the selected ones will appear in a 'Favorite' section.
- There is a button to unselect individual characters and also a reset button, that will clear all from the favorite section.
- The characters added as favorite will continue to be shown when the web is closed and opened again, so the user doesn't have to worry about losing his selections.
